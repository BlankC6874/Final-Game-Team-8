## How we satisfied the software requirements
1. [F0.a]: Our game features a central character, the Farmer, who navigates a 2D grid representing farmland. Movement is implemented using keyboard input, allowing the player to move the character up, down, left, and right between grid cells. The grid layout is clearly defined with visible boundaries, ensuring the player stays within the playing area. This direct control over the character aligns with the requirement of navigating a 2D grid and forms the basis for engaging with the core mechanics of planting and harvesting.
2. [F0.b]: Time progression in our game is turn-based and requires manual input from the player. Each turn is triggered by a specific keypress, such as pressing "Space," ensuring the player has complete control over when to advance the simulation. During each turn, game elements like plant growth, water/moisture accumulation, and sun level adjustments are calculated and updated, giving the player a clear sense of time progression and allowing strategic decision-making at their own pace.
3. [F0.c]: The Farmer can interact with grid cells to sow or reap plants, but only when adjacent to the targeted cell. This proximity requirement ensures that actions feel deliberate and spatially grounded. Attempting to interact with a non-adjacent cell results in no effect, providing clear feedback to the player. This mechanic emphasizes strategic positioning and planning as the player navigates the grid to manage their farm.
4. [F0.d]: Each grid cell in the game tracks its sun and water levels, which are visually represented to the player for clarity. At the start of every turn, each cell's incoming sun and water are generated using a randomization function within predefined limits, simulating natural variability. Sun energy is consumed immediately during plant growth calculations. At the same time, water moisture accumulates over turns, adding a layer of strategy as players must account for varying resource levels across the grid.
5. [F0.e]: Plants in the game belong to one of three distinct species, each with unique growth characteristics. Growth is represented in discrete levels (e.g., Level 1, Level 2, Level 3), with visual and statistical differences that reflect progression. Players can identify each plant's type and growth level at a glance, which aids in planning their actions and achieving growth objectives.
6. [F0.f]: Plant growth is governed by straightforward spatial rules that depend on the sun and water levels of the cells they occupy and the presence of neighboring plants. For example, a plant may require a certain minimum water level and proximity to another plant of the same type to advance to the next growth stage. These rules introduce strategic depth, encouraging players to consider the placement and interactions of plants to optimize their growth.
7. [F0.g]: A play scenario in the game is completed when the player meets a predefined victory condition, such as growing at least a specific number of plants to a certain level (e.g., "5 plants at Level 3"). This condition is communicated to the player at the start of the scenario, providing a clear goal to strive toward. Completing the condition ends the scenario, and the player is shown a performance summary.

## Reflection
Our plan changed from using Unity. After reading the software requirements, our engine lead decided that Unity would be unnecessary for a project like this and that it would be much simpler if we just used typescript and HTML like we have been doing in class. We didn't decide to take any creative approach and decided to stick with a quite barebones design that works. It works as we expected it to, and we might add more to it later on.

## Tools and materials
1. We will be using Unity 2022.3.49f1. We chose Unity because of its familiarity with our Engine Lead, and since it can make a game in both 2D and 3D using Unity, we can be flexible with what we choose to create. On top of that, it has a robust asset store and extensive documentation, allowing us to access more resources and support. We can aim to create a more polished product using integrated systems like physics and animation.
2. The programming language we will use is C# since that is what Unity expects.
3. Our project will use Visual Studio as our primary IDE for coding due to its robust debugging tools, Unity integration, and the team's familiarity with it, as we've been using it since we first learned programming. For visual assets, we will rely on Photoshop for its versatility in creating high-quality textures and UI elements. At the same time, Aseprite will be used for pixel art adjustments and animations due to its lightweight design and specialization in sprite editing. The project will primarily be developed using Unity 2023, which was strongly recommended by our Engine Lead, Brian, given his experience with the engine, ensuring we can efficiently address any challenges while leveraging Unity's powerful features.
4. Our alternate platform choice is still Unity, but instead of focusing on a traditional PC or console game, we will explore deploying the project as a mobile game. This approach will allow us to experiment with Unity's mobile optimization features, such as touch input integration and performance scaling for smaller devices. We will adapt our user interface and gameplay mechanics by targeting mobile to fit different audiences and platform requirements. This alternate focus helps us expand our understanding of Unity's versatility while creating a version of the game that reaches a broader audience.

## Outlook
Most teams want to make some easy games, but we will make a game that is easy but fun for everyone who plays it. The coding part will be challenging because we must code in a new language: C#. We hope we will survive that! (and we will.) We will socialize more with each other and learn how to manage unity well!
