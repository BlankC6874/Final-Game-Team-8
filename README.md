# Devlog Entry - [11/15/2024]
## Introducing the team
1. Tools Lead: Qihe Wang (qwang122)
2. Engine Lead: Brian Jin (amphy0)
3. Assistant Engine Lead: Bolan Guan (chargeling)
4. Creative Lead: Guangyang Chen (BlankC6874)

## Tools and materials
1. We will be using Unity 2022.3.49f1. We chose Unity because of its familiarity with our Engine Lead, and since it can make a game in both 2D and 3D using Unity, we can be flexible with what we choose to create. On top of that, it has a robust asset store and extensive documentation, allowing us to access more resources and support. We can aim to create a more polished product using integrated systems like physics and animation.
2. The programming language we will use is C# since that is what Unity expects.
3. Our project will use Visual Studio as our primary IDE for coding due to its robust debugging tools, Unity integration, and the team's familiarity with it, as we've been using it since we first learned programming. For visual assets, we will rely on Photoshop for its versatility in creating high-quality textures and UI elements. At the same time, Aseprite will be used for pixel art adjustments and animations due to its lightweight design and specialization in sprite editing. The project will primarily be developed using Unity 2023, which was strongly recommended by our Engine Lead, Brian, given his experience with the engine, ensuring we can efficiently address any challenges while leveraging Unity's powerful features.
4. Our alternate platform choice is still Unity, but instead of focusing on a traditional PC or console game, we will explore deploying the project as a mobile game. This approach will allow us to experiment with Unity's mobile optimization features, such as touch input integration and performance scaling for smaller devices. We will adapt our user interface and gameplay mechanics by targeting mobile to fit different audiences and platform requirements. This alternate focus helps us expand our understanding of Unity's versatility while creating a version of the game that reaches a broader audience.

## Outlook
Most teams want to make some easy games, but we will make a game that is easy to play but fun for everyone who plays it. The coding part will be a challenge for us because we will have to code in a new language: C#. We hope we will survive that !(and we will.) We will make more socials with each other and learn how to manage unity well!
